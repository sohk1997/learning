## **Blockchain component**

- Ledger (associate with accountant) - a collection of transaction. In blockchain, the ledger is distributed (or decentralize) -> no one/ everyone own the ledger.
- A transaction is compose of sender, receiver and the assets
- Some of blockchain implementation have smart contract. Smart contract is rule to make transaction of block chain.
- There are public blockchain and private blockchain.
- In blockchain network, there are nodes. Each nodes have the copy of ledger
- Private blockchain have the authorization/authentication service (aka membership service provider)
- Have identity of user, achieved by PKI provide public key -> identity of the user on the network. And the private key store in wallet (**wallet is a collection of the user credentials**)
- People interact with blockchain through **event**

## **Basic terms of blockchain**
### Ethereum
- Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is a decentralized open-source blockchain. Unlike the Bitcoin Network, the Ethereum Protocol has the ability to run smart contracts. The cryptocurrency running on the Ethereum network is called Ether.
### Smart Contracts
- A smart contract is computer code that can be run on a blockchain that executes the conditions of an agreement.
### Public Blockchains
- Public blockchain has no barrier to entry. Anyone with a cell phone and a digital wallet can transact on the blockchain.
### Private Blockchains
- Private blockchains or permissioned blockchains have a Membership Services piece that grants access to users before they can interact with the blockchain.
### Digital Wallet
- A digital wallet is a computer application that represents a traditional wallet. It gives the user the ability to store and transact cryptocurrencies through the Internet.
### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Public Key Infrastructure is the identity management system for instilling trust into the electronic transfers of information or value. It is the technology used to authenticate users and information by issuing a set of key pairs (public and private).
