# **Blockchain component**

- Ledger (associate with accountant) - a collection of transaction. In blockchain, the ledger is distributed (or decentralize) -> no one/ everyone own the ledger.
- A transaction is compose of sender, receiver and the assets
- Some of blockchain implementation have smart contract. Smart contract is rule to make transaction of block chain.
- There are public blockchain and private blockchain.
- In blockchain network, there are nodes. Each nodes have the copy of ledger
- Private blockchain have the authorization/authentication service (aka membership service provider)
- Have identity of user, achieved by PKI provide public key -> identity of the user on the network. And the private key store in wallet (**wallet is a collection of the user credentials**)
- People interact with blockchain through **event**

## **Basic terms of blockchain**
### Ethereum
- Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is a decentralized open-source blockchain. Unlike the Bitcoin Network, the Ethereum Protocol has the ability to run smart contracts. The cryptocurrency running on the Ethereum network is called Ether.
### Smart Contracts
- A smart contract is computer code that can be run on a blockchain that executes the conditions of an agreement.
### Public Blockchains
- Public blockchain has no barrier to entry. Anyone with a cell phone and a digital wallet can transact on the blockchain.
### Private Blockchains
- Private blockchains or permissioned blockchains have a Membership Services piece that grants access to users before they can interact with the blockchain.
### Digital Wallet
- A digital wallet is a computer application that represents a traditional wallet. It gives the user the ability to store and transact cryptocurrencies through the Internet.
### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Public Key Infrastructure is the identity management system for instilling trust into the electronic transfers of information or value. It is the technology used to authenticate users and information by issuing a set of key pairs (public and private).

### **In decentralized ledger, it's hard to cheat (51% of copy need to be updated). Event though a node come down, there still other nodes hold the transaction history**.

## **Blockchain = concept of ledger+distributed system**

# **Cryptography and trust**

## **Basic term of cryptography**
### Cryptography
- Cryptography is a technique used to secure the communication between two parties from a third. The term cryptography is derived from two ancient greek terms, “kryptos” which means “hidden” and “graphein” which means “to write”.
### Secret
- The data which we are trying to protect.
### Key
- A piece of data used for encrypting and decrypting the secret.
### Function
- The process or function used to encrypt the secret.
### Cipher
- The encrypted secret data, the digital secret, the output of the mathematical function or a cryptographic algorithm.
### Encryption
- This is the process from plain text (ordinary text) to cipher text (random sequence of bits).
### Decryption
- Encryption is the reverse process of converting ciphertext into plain text.

**One of the technologies that plays a pivotal role in blockchain and making blockchain secure and immutable is cryptography.**

## **Byzantine Fault Tolerance -> the idea make blockchain become more secure**

## Types of Cryptography in Blockchain

### Public Key Cryptography
- This encryption method uses a pair of keys: an encryption key, and a decryption key, named public key and private key, respectively. The key pair generated by this algorithm consists of a private key and a unique public key that is generated using the same algorithm.
### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- A new approach to protecting digital secrets that prove knowledge of a secret without revealing it.
### Hash Functions
- This type of encryption doesn’t make use of keys. It uses a cipher to generate a hash value of a fixed length. The function converts plain text (no matter the size) into a hash of fixed size. It is nearly impossible for the contents of plain text to be recovered from the cipher text. Think of it like trying to recreate a human from a fingerprint, a fingerprint uniquely represents a human no matter the size of the human and you can’t reverse engineer a fingerprint to recreate the human.
### Merkle Trees
- A data storage technique that compresses or packs data for storing blockchains with a tamper-free component built in. Merkle trees are built upon hashing principles in that each hash becomes a part of the next hash to build a tamper resistant data storage model.
